CombineALL.bas is a VBA script I wrote for class that analyzes stock data.

It loops through rows of data to return info such as the unique ticker of each listed stock, the total stock volume, & which stock had the greatest yearly increase.

CombineALL works on multiple sheets of a workbook & also does some text formatting at the end of its loop.  

The project is finally at a complete status!

As for sources, I googled quite a bit and found less than 1% of results in any way helpful.  Lots of bad, useless, or completely irrelevant info out there.  

I referred back to Dr. A's credit card charges zoom video & my notes on it, and I got some useful info (though a suprisingly small amount) from Microsoft's VBA library. 

A few answered questions on StackOverflow yielded little bits of info, usually what the VBA function was for such & such a thing that I know how to do in Excel. Wish I could say the openvalue variable was easier to calculate with what I found--in the end it was mostly a crapton of trial and error and really missing PowerQuery.
